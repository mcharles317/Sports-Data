1. Based on the metrics choosen, the teams with the highest zscore rating are UCF, UNLV, New Mexico, Oreon, and Wright State.

2. On the Z-scale, Maryland ranks 39th out of 345 teams. Just ahead of them is Cal and Michigan. Right behind them is San Jose St. and Steven F. Austin. 

3. We specifically chose these new metrics because we felt they added additional context. We added three different block statistics as blocks are a major part of the sport and can give context to the outcome of games. For this same reason, we added the average score of the both teams because it gives context to how close the games are and whether that is impacted by the statistics we choose.
