This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
Soccer2021W<- read_csv("downloads/ncaa_womens_soccer_totals_2021.csv")
 
```
```{r}
gpg <- Soccer2021W %>% 
  mutate(gpg = Goals/Games) %>% 
  group_by(Conference) %>% 
  filter(Conference == "Big Ten") %>% 
  arrange(desc(gpg))
```
```{r}
football <- read_csv ("http://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/footballlogs21.csv")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
