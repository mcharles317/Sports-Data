This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{R}
SoccerW<- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/NCAAWomensSoccerData/main/data/ncaa_womens_soccer_matchstats_2022.csv")
```


```{R}
SoccerW %>%
 group_by(team) %>% 
  filter(team == "Maryland Terrapins, Terps") %>% 
  summarise(total_shots = sum(sh_att), total_quality_shots = sum(so_g)) %>% 
  mutate(percentage_quality_shots = (total_quality_shots/total_shots)*100) %>% 
  arrange(desc(percentage_quality_shots))
  
```
```{r}
matches_2021 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/NCAAWomensSoccerData/main/data/ncaa_womens_soccer_matchstats_2021.csv")
```
```{r}
matches_2021 %>% 
  filter(team == "Maryland Terrapins, Terps", date < "2021-09-05") %>% 
  group_by(team) %>% 
 summarise(total_terps_shots = sum(sh_att), total_quality_shots = sum(so_g)) %>%
mutate(percent_quality_shots = (total_quality_shots/total_terps_shots)*100)
```
```{r}
draws <- SoccerW %>% 
  group_by(team) %>% 
  filter(result == "T") %>% 
  summarise(total = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total))
```
Question 3: 4 other teams also had 4 draws. 

```{r}
corners <- SoccerW %>%
  filter(team == "Maryland Terrapins, Terps") %>% 
  group_by(team) %>% 
  summarise(md_corners = sum(corners), opp_corners = sum(defensive_corners)) %>% 
  mutate(difference = md_corners - opp_corners)
  
all_team_corners <- SoccerW %>% 
  group_by(team) %>% 
  summarise(team_corners = sum(corners), other_team_corners = sum(defensive_corners)) %>% 
  mutate(difference = team_corners - other_team_corners) %>% 
  arrange(desc(difference))
```
```{r}
correlations <- read_csv("~/Desktop/jour479x_fall_2022/data/ncaa_womens_soccer_matchstats_2022.csv")
```
```{r}
newcorrelations <- correlations %>% 
  mutate(differential = goals - defensive_goals)
```
```{r}
newcorrelations %>% summarise(correlation = cor(differential, fouls, method="pearson"))
```
```{r}
newcorrelations %>% 
  summarise(correlation = cor(differential, yellow_cards, method="pearson"))
```
```{r}
fit <- lm(differential ~ fouls, data = newcorrelations)
summary(fit)
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
